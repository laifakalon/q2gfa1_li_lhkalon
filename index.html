            <p> Understanding cats natural history reveals just how recently
                cats came indoors and how community cats continue to live
                healthy lives outdoorsâ€”as all domestic cats are biologically
                adapted to do. Only since 1947, with the invention of kitty
                litter, has it become common for cats to live indoors as they
                do today. In fact, cats have lived primarily outdoors alongside
                humans, sharing the environment with birds and wildlife, for over
                10,000 years. Its important to be familiar with the history of cat
                domestication, as those who oppose TNR often think community
                cats are homeless and dont belong outdoors. The truth is that
                community cats have always lived outdoors and have a place in
                the natural landscape.
